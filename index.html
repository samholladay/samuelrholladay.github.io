        <p> Sam began life as just another San Francisco techie, resigned to the clickety-clack life of engineering. While he still works for a paycheck every day, he
        decided to live a little bit and work in indie film as a screenwriter and director. He hopes one day the Bay Area film scene will make a glorious comeback.</p>
        <p>His work spans genres from satire to horror, often with a focus on social and class dynamics. He has written three feature-length screenplays (about, respectively: the young Stalin, model conspiracies in Los Angeles, and techie hostage crises), and more than 10 short scripts. He has directed two short films. </p>
        <p><a href="never-say-youre-sorry.html" target="_blank"> Never Say You're Sorry</a> 
        (in collaboration with 
        <a href="https://encountersfilms.com/" target="_blank"> Encounters Film Collective</a>) screened at the <a href="https://www.ahith.com/" target="_blank"> 2023 Another Hole in the Head Film Festival</a> in San Francisco. His second short film is in post-production, and will probably screen in an abandoned mineshaft in Siberia when it is done. </p>
